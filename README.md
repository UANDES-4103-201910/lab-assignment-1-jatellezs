3. First in the elements tab we can see the use of the html tag which is used to define the type of language that 
   is being used for this page.
   
   Then we can see the use of the head data ehich is used to store elements such as the title tag that defines
   the name that is displayed in the google chrome tab, the meta tag which stores metadata (information that
   is not displayed in the page, but is used in other areas), and the link tag which is a link to external sources
   that provide multiple things to the page, such as icons and css files.
   
   Finally we have the body tag, which encapsules all of the information that is displayed in the page that we can
   see, such as tables, news titles, headers, etc. Inside the body tag we can find the following tags:
   
   - center: this tag is used to define at which part of the page the data is displayed.
   
   - table: this tag creates a table instance to be displayed with the given format.
   
   - tbody: this tag is used to group the content in the table. (inside this tag we find the next group of tags)
   
   - tr: creates a new row in the specified table.
   
   - td: defines a new cell in the specified table.
   
   - a: the 'a' tag defines a hyperlink to link from one page to another.
   
   - span: this tag is used mainly to add a type of style to the block.
   
   - script: finally this tag is used to define a javascript to be used by the page (it can point to an external
             source using src).
            

4. The files inside Sources are the following:

   - (index): this file is used to define the format and style of all the elements of the page, this includes things 
              such as positioning, margins, font, size, title, references, etc.
              
   - hn.js?5rgSLyaCjnnNgCLKQdUi: this file is the javascript that is used in the current page. It contains several 
                                 functions that define actions to be taken when a certain condition is met. This is used
                                 mainly to do this like image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
                                 
   - news.css?5rgSLyaCjnnNgCLKQdUi: this is the css file that is used in the page. This file describes how HTML elements 
                                    are to be displayed on screen.
                                    
   - .gif files: this are images, icons, gifs that are to be displayed on screen when called by.
   
   
5. XHR or XMLHttpRequest is used to obtain information of a URL without having to recharge the entire page, it works 
   similiar to what ajax does. The files previously mentioned are loaded before the page shows on screen, with the exception
   of favicon.ico.
   
6. This website uses a certificate emitted by COMODO RSA Domain Validation Secure Server CA.
